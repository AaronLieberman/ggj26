# "Masque-Produced"
Global Game Jam 2026
Weekend of 1/30/2026

## Overview
Run a mask-making shop for eccentric customers in search of the perfect disguise. Assemble masks from a conveyor belt of parts to create just the right look for each client. A luchador-wannabe, a mysterious villain, a cat-loving tea enthusiast… Can you give everyone the face they’re looking for before time runs out?
