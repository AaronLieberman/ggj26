# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
Game Jam 2026 game. Goal is to complete the game in 48 hours. We have an artist, several programmers, and a couple designers.

## Technology

- We'll be using Unity and C#.
- The game will be in 2D.

## Theme
TBD

## Sub-Projects

Each sub-project has its own detailed CLAUDE.md file with specific development commands and architecture details. For quick reference:

### 1. GameJam26/ - Unity project that represents the game jam code and assets. *PRIMARY DEVELOPMENT AREA*
- **Technology**: Unity 6.3, C#

## Git Usage

- Commit messages are extremely concise and reference why and how. What-type info can be present but is minimal unless it's suprising. There should be no mention of AI agents in the commit descriptions.
